# Advice from an (almost) PhD for almost to start PhDs.

To be clear from the get go, this advice largely holds for non-american programs, solely because I have no idea how your programs work with all the courses y'all have to do and what it means to be a candidate and otherwise. Hopefully some of this still applies to you, but who knows. (Especially given it seems like it often takes more than 3-ish years, a lot of this advice is based in the PhD being a fairly short intense thing, probably, who knows rn.)

If you don't give a shit about who I am, skip to 'First off,'.

Okay, so let's establish who I am first. It's important to make sure the person you're taking advice from isn't a pure bullshit merchant. I'm Jamie. 
I did my undergraduate at Aberystwyth (which is one of the most amazing places, although tbf I get the feeling most people who didn't go to oxbridge think this). 
I graduated with a first class integrated masters in mathematics. I will dedicate another post solely to Aber, it's a truly beautiful place and I couldn't recommend it enough tbh. 
Anyway, I then moved onto Warwick as part of the Diamond Science and Technology Center for Doctoral Training (a year of my life truly made by the people I shared it with). 
This masters degree focused on the superlative properties of diamond. For me there were three main takeaways. 
    1. As cringy as it is, the people I met. You're all beautiful people. This is a common theme, I am extraordinarily lucky in the people I meet in my life.
    2. I Spent 10 weeks in Oxford with good friends researching quantum memories. I learnt a lot about quantum memories and Oxford. Also got to spend a lot of time drinking earlier in the day than we should have been with a good friend, that's worth a lot.
        * My Oxford experience was really improved by the wonderful senior people of the warwick DST and Lincoln college. I'm not in the business of publicly naming people, but my 'dst-mentor' and their friends where so welcoming and wonderful.
        * As an aside, Oxford has issues it really needs to deal with. I will write about this later, but institutionally it's one of the least progressive places I've ever experienced. I have never witnessed so much institutional dissatisfaction with a place. Especially from minority students. That needs to change before I can consider Oxford a top tier uni (I can only talk for what I have experienced, if this is true for other russel groups, then they're not top tier other in my eyes, it's just quite extreme at Oxford). 
    3. I got to go back to Aber and research quantum control systems. It's a beautiful place and I never wanted to leave it. 


To be fair, I don't know how to prove the above to you. Ask me something about real analysis, diamond and multi-dim quantum parameter estimation maybe??


First off, doing a PhD is cool, it's very fun to be paid (the minimum amount the UK government, at least, decree is enough to live off (if you're doing your PhD in a scandi nation, or maybe Switzerland, I envy you... haha)) in order to do something you're passionate about. Step 1 is taking that in, this is an amazing amount of freedom and it should be a good time for you, if it's not, you're brilliant and the world is still your oyster.

Second off, fuck imposter syndrome, you're brilliant. Easier said than done. 
I of course experience from imposter syndrome, it's natural, somewhat. 
The issue is when you let it take over your life. First of, on my second off point, if you're reading this, you're brilliant. That is regardless of PhD, education, circumstance and whatever, fuck the bell curve/IQ shite. 
I truly believe we're all capable of doing amazing things, but more importantly we're capable of making ourselves happy. 
That should be the #1 goal. 
But I'm pontificating somewhat from a truly privileged position, that should be known.
My point on imposter syndrome is that yes, you will probably feel it, you're surrounded by brilliant people. Just remember that brilliant people are dumbasses too, they've just been in the game for longer. 
We're all dumb and brilliant at the same time. 

Finally, I mention this early because it's important. Find someone from the year above you and find out how much administrative bullshit you can ignore until you're told otherwise.
