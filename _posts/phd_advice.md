# Advice from an (almost) PhD for almost to start PhDs.

To be clear from the get go, this advice largely holds for non-american programs, solely because I have no idea how your programs work with all the courses y'all have to do and what it means to be a candidate and otherwise. Hopefully some of this still applies to you, but who knows. (Especially given it seems like it often takes more than 3-ish years, a lot of this advice is based in the PhD being a fairly short intense thing, probably, who knows rn.)

If you don't give a shit about who I am, skip to 'First off,'.

Okay, so let's establish who I am first. It's important to make sure the person you're taking advice from isn't a pure bullshit merchant. I'm Jamie. 
I did my undergraduate at Aberystwyth (which is one of the most amazing places, although tbf I get the feeling most people who didn't go to oxbridge think this). 
I graduated with a first class integrated masters in mathematics. I will dedicate another post solely to Aber, it's a truly beautiful place and I couldn't recommend it enough tbh. 
Anyway, I then moved onto Warwick as part of the Diamond Science and Technology Center for Doctoral Training (a year of my life truly made by the people I shared it with). 
This masters degree focused on the superlative properties of diamond. For me there were three main takeaways. 
    1. As cringy as it is, the people I met. You're all beautiful people. This is a common theme, I am extraordinarily lucky in the people I meet in my life.
    2. I Spent 10 weeks in Oxford with good friends researching quantum memories. I learnt a lot about quantum memories and Oxford. Also got to spend a lot of time drinking earlier in the day than we should have been with a good friend, that's worth a lot.
        * My Oxford experience was really improved by the wonderful senior people of the warwick DST and Lincoln college. I'm not in the business of publicly naming people, but my 'dst-mentor' and their friends where so welcoming and wonderful.
        * As an aside, Oxford has issues it really needs to deal with. I will write about this later, but institutionally it's one of the least progressive places I've ever experienced. I have never witnessed so much institutional dissatisfaction with a place. Especially from minority students. That needs to change before I can consider Oxford a top tier uni (I can only talk for what I have experienced, if this is true for other russel groups, then they're not top tier other in my eyes, it's just quite extreme at Oxford). 
    3. I got to go back to Aber and research quantum control systems. It's a beautiful place and I never wanted to leave it. 


To be fair, I don't know how to prove the above to you. Ask me something about real analysis, diamond and multi-dim quantum parameter estimation maybe??


First off, doing a PhD is cool, it's very fun to be paid (the minimum amount the UK government, at least, decree is enough to live off (if you're doing your PhD in a scandi nation, or maybe Switzerland, I envy you... haha)) in order to do something you're passionate about. Step 1 is taking that in, this is an amazing amount of freedom and it should be a good time for you, if it's not, you're brilliant and the world is still your oyster.

Second off, fuck imposter syndrome, you're brilliant. Easier said than done. 
I of course experience from imposter syndrome, it's natural, somewhat. 
The issue is when you let it take over your life. First of, on my second off point, if you're reading this, you're brilliant. That is regardless of PhD, education, circumstance and whatever, fuck the bell curve/IQ shite. 
I truly believe we're all capable of doing amazing things, but more importantly we're capable of making ourselves happy. 
That should be the #1 goal. 
But I'm pontificating somewhat from a truly privileged position, that should be known.
My point on imposter syndrome is that yes, you will probably feel it, you're surrounded by brilliant people. Just remember that brilliant people are dumbasses too, they've just been in the game for longer. 
We're all dumb and brilliant at the same time. 

So, thirdly, you really got to enjoy it. The PhD it short and intense, but it's also amazing. Really take it in. Read random academic crap, go to random seminars, join random clubs, make new friends

Somewhere in the middle, I don't care where. Ignore all advice about how many hours you should/shouldn't be working. Changes are, you'll be working more than a 40h week, because hopefully you fucking love what you're doing. You will see a lot of conflicting advice online that says "you must work 120597346y5974 hours a week or you're a week prick" or "if you work more than 37.5 hours you're part of the problem.". For me, these are both profoundly wrong. At a PhD you should really love what you're doing, as such more than your 'contracted' hours is to be expected. However, the big demon that will haunt you is burn out. I have been there, working until 3am, waking, and starting up again. It'll be the end of you. The really important thing is to make sure that what you're doing is sustainable for however long your funding is. Burn out is retchet and something I have experienced first hand. There is something to be said for your PhD is short, so hard work is not the worst. However, I disagree with this, whatever you do, your long term happiness is fore front. (As implied I have worked myslef like a dog and burnt out, I will not lie to you that this hasn't happened).

Reading is important. Personally I recomendend that Monday morn and Friday afternoon are dedicated to paper reading

Finally, I mention this because it's important. Find someone from the year above you and find out how much administrative stuff you can get away with. There is a lot that is of great value, like posters and talks. There is also a lot that is not of great value that you are able to not do until you have to, imo. I understand why universities operate in the way they do, I really do. That doesn't mean that I am not of the belief that some fat could do with trimming. Of course, I am in the process of completing everything required of me. There is always a rational to the tasks laid before you, and not doing the work is never worth not getting your PhD.
