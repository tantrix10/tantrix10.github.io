I like to do crafts to wind down in the evenings from my other hobbies that can be quite intense 

Crochet
======
I have no crochet projects currently, a large hodge-podge blanket and a hoddie :) I'll post some progress pictures soon!


Origami
======

I originally enjoyed modular origami for large sculpture like work, however recently I have been enjoying the smaller tilling pieces and flower pieces.
